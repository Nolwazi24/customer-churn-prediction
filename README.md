# customer-churn-prediction

 Project Overview

This project explores customer churn data to understand why customers leave and builds a machine learning model to predict churn. The goal is to provide insights that can help businesses reduce churn and improve customer retention.

 Key Steps

1.Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

-Handled missing values and formatted categorical/numerical features.

2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

-Visualized customer demographics, billing patterns, and service usage.

-Identified key drivers of churn.

3.Feature Engineering

-Encoded categorical variables.

-Scaled numerical features.

4.Machine Learning Model

-Built and evaluated ML models to predict churn.

-Compared performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).

Insights

Monthly charges, contract type, and tenure strongly influence churn.

Tech Stack

-Python
-Jupyter Notebook
-Pandas, NumPy
-Matplotlib, Seaborn
-Scikit-learn

Results

Identified top predictors of churn: Tenure, MonthlyCharges, Contract type.

Built a churn prediction model with strong performance in identifying at-risk customers.
